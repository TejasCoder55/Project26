Take 2 slices of bread with butter on a pan,fry it for some time.
Then we need to take greated cheese in 4 different cups.
In each cup we put different food colourings (red,blue,yellow,green)as per choice
And mix them
Then the last step is to spread the coloured cheese line by line ,close the bread after the cheese melts 
and cut it horizontaly,colourfull layers of cheese would come out and then enjoy.
